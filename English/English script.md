## Mental health apps

### 1. Introduction
- About 29% of people will experience a mental disorder in their lifetime.
- up to 55% people with mental disorders in developed countries and 85% in developing ones are not getting the treatment they need
- There are big gaps in public mental health: Information, governance, resources and services -> Scant spending, scarce workforce, digital divide, lack of essential medicines, etc.

### 2. Mental health apps
- Digital technologies – from websites and online platforms to smartphones and mobile applications – have long been able to help people achieve better mental health.
- The UK's National Health Service (NHS) and the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) have pointed to mental health apps as cost-effective and scalable solutions to addressing the mental health treatment gap
- mHealth apps' target users can be clinical providers or patients --> Our focus in this presentation are apps for patients
- mHealth apps target a broad range of psychological disorders and vary in design and functionality
	- NIMH 6 categories: self-management, cognition improvement, skills-training, social support, symptom tracking, and passive data collection
	- There are apps for psychosis, depression, anxiety, alcohol use disorders, smoking cessation, sleep disturbance, and weight loss.
	- Spans all stages of clinical care provision: immeadiate crisis intervention, prevention, diagnosis, primary treatment, supplement to in-person therapy, post-treatment condition management
	
- We will now take a closer look on remote care apps (tele-mental health), meditation and relaxation apps, and apps to help cope with mental disorders
**1. Remote care:**
	- Put service users and mental health professionals in touch remotely
	- Sessions can be held through videoconferencing, online messaging or by telephone
	- The professionals can make evaluations, provide therapy, prescribe medication, etc.
	- Patients can connect with a suitable specialist in online marketplaces and order individual therapy, couple sessions, psychiatry consultations, etc.
	- Examples: BetterHelp, Talkspace
2. **Meditation and relaxation**
	- Aim: checking general psychological health and preventing major issues by reducing stress, anxiety, and frustration, improving sleep, etc.
	- Primarily rely on relaxation and meditation techniques but may also track emotions, sleep patterns, habits, symptoms, etc.
	- Examples: Headspace, Happify, Mindshift, etc.
3. **Coping with mental disorders**
	- Usually use proven treatment methods like cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), acceptance commitment therapy (ACT), etc. combined with mindfulness training, mood monitoring, etc.
	- Research done on depression, anxiety and Schizophrenia apps revealed that using these apps can help with alleviating symptoms, especially when coupled with traditional therapy
	- Examples: ACT Coach, PTSD Coach

### Advantages and disadvantages
#### 1. Advantages
- Flexibility: Flexible and can fit in many different lifestyles, access mental health care whenever and whenever you want
- Accessibility: particularly in rural and low-income regions
	- I come from a developing country: mental health is still almost a taboo issue, so help is very hard to get by and usually cost a lot of money. We don't have counselling in schools and universities. Counselling can only be found in places like mental hospitals and camps for drug addicts 
- Disposability: Many apps to choose from, can be uninstalled any time compared to finding a psychiatrist, which is a very lengthy process
	- You can easily download an app, uninstall an app, or try anything for 7 or 30 days, the possibilities are endless. You have the ability to choose the method that suits you the best, unlike in traditional therapy, where you have to stick with one therapist until the end because it takes so much time finding another one
- No/Less stigma —> if people are not quite ready to maybe go and see their doctor, then it might be a first step to seeking help
	- Once again in Asian countries: Mental health is a taboo subject: we dont talk about it and its not a REAL problem. So we just bottle it all in and never really had the chance to tackle our emotions heads on
- High engagement: Apps can interact with users proactively: real-time engagement, usage reminders, gamified interactions -> fun to use, can create habits
	- I am using an app where each journal entry I write give me in game currency to dress up my in game pet bird. It sounds tacky but it manages to hook me in and make me take some time for myself every day to tackle my emotions and put them into words
#### 2. Disadvantages
- Clinical effectiveness: But the technology is moving a lot faster than the science. Although there is some evidence that empirically based, well-designed mental-health apps can improve outcomes for patients, the vast majority remain unstudied
- Clinical risks: Apps may be harmful or giving dangerous advice or preventing people from going and getting proper treatment
- Inaccessibility: There are people who do not have, or cannot afford, smartphones or mobile internet access. Apps remain to be expensive to those from lower-income countries. The content of apps needs to be delivered in local languages and reflect local cultures. 
--> Relying on digital technologies to deliver mental health services risks excluding some of the world’s most vulnerable people from accessing the care they need and fails to address the full spectrum of mental health conditions that people experience.
- Privacy issues: how the data will be used by the app service because you really don't want Facebook to know that you're depressed

### Conclusion
- Mobile apps have significant potential to deliver high-efficacy mental health interventions. 
- Given the global shortage of psychiatrists and the lack of mental health care access in rural regions, apps have emerged as a viable tool to bridge the mental health treatment gap.
- Technology is well-poised to transform how mental health treatment is delivered and accessed, but this transformation requires the combined mobilization of science, regulation, and design.
